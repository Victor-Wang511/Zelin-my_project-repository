This project is aimed at investigating the adherence between the pharmacy pick-up frequency and the Viral load suression.
Please install dplyr package before running my current codes! Thank you!
For my class project, I decide to use the 2016-2020 pharmacy HIV medicines pick up data and HIV Viral load data, HIV CD4 data from an urban Ryan White funded clinic. 
Basically, the analysis based on the adherence between the pick up frequency and the HIV severity indicators ï¼ˆViral load level and CD4 count) will be condecuted, in order to see the result of the medecine suppression.
The output is supposed to contain the suppression level of the patients after the medicare treatments. It will contain the basic frequency tables and the variation of the indicators through out the research conducting pediod. Each individual will be assigned with a 1 year follow up period.
I prefer to use R to write the program. Since there are graphs and tables that going to be generated, R packages may be applied such as dplyr and ggplot2.
